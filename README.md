# Pago_GWI_Modeling
### Code Repository for American Samoa Pago Harbor GWI modeling under future SLR


American Samoa is one of the most isolated and vulnerable places in the U.S. to climate impacts. In this study we used a numerical groundwater model to predict groundwater inundation effects at 0.6, 1.5 and 2.4 m of sea level rise. By intersecting locations of buried and surface based infrastructure with predicted groundwater levels we determined where impacts would be greatest. With 2.4 m of sea level rise 45% of buried infrastructure And 28% of surface infrastructure was projected to be permanently flooded. Managers in American Samoa plan to use this information for future project remitting and planning
